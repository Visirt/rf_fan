"""Mercator FRM87/FRM97 protocol helpers: read captured frames, then (later)
generate clean ones.

Per rtl_433 issue #2200 the remote is OOK at 433.92 MHz with a base cell of
~333us; each data bit spans 3 cells (symbol one = 110, symbol zero = 010). The
button is a one-hot field, so light / off / each speed are the *same* frame
differing in a single bit. Rather than reconstruct the exact bit map from the
(ambiguous) published notation, we work empirically from the user's own captured
frames - which is robust to the DIP-switch address and to Broadlink's timing.

A capture contains the frame repeated several times, separated by long gaps. We
split on those gaps, render each frame as a cell string (``H`` = high cell,
``l`` = low cell; a long pulse/gap = two cells), and take the most common frame
as the consensus - noise then shows up as low agreement.
